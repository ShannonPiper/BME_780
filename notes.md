## Biological networks:

* What are the inputs, outputs, compenents, etc. of the network

* Models: a simplified description to represent known facts and hypotheses about the system.

    * Can be verbal/text, picture/diagrams, mathematical equations, computer algorithms.
    
    * Pictures: intuitive and easy to develop, but hard to make precise, no well-defined rules, etc.
    
* Mathematical models:

    * what makes a model good?
        * Accurate model
        * Predictive model
        * falsifiable, validated.
    * Keep in mind:
        * No models are true
        * All models are simplified idealized descriptions
        * Models have scope.
