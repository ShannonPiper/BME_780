## Biological networks:

* What are the inputs, outputs, compenents, etc. of the network

* Models: a simplified description to represent known facts and hypotheses about the system.

    * Can be verbal/text, picture/diagrams, mathematical equations, computer algorithms.
    
    * Pictures: intuitive and easy to develop, but hard to make precise, no well-defined rules, etc.
    
* Mathematical models:

    * what makes a model good?
        * Accurate model
        * Predictive model
        * falsifiable, validated.
    * Keep in mind:
        * No models are true
        * All models are simplified idealized descriptions
        * Models have scope.

## Machine Learning

Overview:
* Based on recognizing patterns.
* Classifier we choose determines what type of rule (boundary) we can draw
    * Simple classifier example; logistic regression
    
* Need to divide date into 3 chunks:
    * One to learn a rule
    * One to find the model
    * One to test and make sure the model is repeatable on another set of data that you took out, not just the set that you used to make the model.


When reading paper next week, see if you can identify the ingredients (labeled training dataset w/ N items: input description x and output y, model: rules for how to predict y from x for a new iten f(x) = y, goal/objective: minimize the prediction errors and maximize the likelihood.
